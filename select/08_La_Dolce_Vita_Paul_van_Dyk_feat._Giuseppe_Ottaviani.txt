We're walking like in a Dolce Vita
This time we got it right
We're living like in a Dolce Vita
Mmm, gonna dream tonight
We're dancing like in a Dolce Vita
With lights and music on
Our love is made in the Dolce Vita
Nobody else than you
It's our last night together with our love again
Another light before we drown in darkness
Say you'll never leave me now
Say you're gonna love me
It's our last night together with our love again
Another light before we drown in darkness
Say you'll never leave me now
Say you're gonna love me now
Haha!
We're walking like in a Dolce Vita
Mmm, gonna dream tonight
We're dancing like in a Dolce Vita
Nobody else than you
It's our last night together with our love again
Another light before we drown in darkness
Say you'll never leave me now
Oh, say you're gonna love me
It's our last night together with our love again
Another light before we drown in darkness
Say you'll never leave me now
Say you're gonna love me now
